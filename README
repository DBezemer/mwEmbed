p. This javascript library enables you to take advantage of the "html5 @<video>@ and @<audio>@ tags":https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_audio_and_video_in_FireFox today with a consistent player interface across all major browsers including Internet Explorer.

p. The library supports a seamless fallback with Flash based playback (using Kaltura's media player -- KDP3) or Java Cortado for browsers that don't yet feature HTML5 video & audio support.  Upon detection of the client browser, the Kaltura HTML5 library chooses the right codec to use (specified in the source attributes) and the right player to display.  So whether you're using flash, h264, ogg-theora, or WebM -- Kaltura's library will make sure it is played on all browsers with the same html based UI.

p. While support for HTML5 video is growing, there is large percentage of the web browser market that is presently best served by the Adobe Flash plugin and an associated player. A base component of the Kaltura HTML5 javascript library bridges this gap, by cascading to an underlining Flash player in browsers that do not support the native HTML5 video player. In addition, Kaltura's player maintains a unified look & feel across formats and browsers. Kaltura's platform provides automatic transcoding into all supported formats (WebM, OGG, H.264, MOV, FLV etc.)

p. *Coming soon!* Kalturas' HTML5 video player will soon support all advanced video management capabilities, including analytics and monetization, making it commercially viable on devices such as the Apple iPhone, that do not support Flash.

h2. Basic Usage

p. Using *Kaltura's HTML5 video library* in your own applications is as simple as adding a script include of the library javascript, @http://html5.kaltura.org/js@ and then using the normal html5 video tag, ie @<video src="myOgg.ogg">@ .

p. Putting it all together your embed page should look something like this:

bc. <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://html5.kaltura.org/js" > </script> 
</head>
<body>
  <video id="video" style="width:544px;height:304px;" 
    poster="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Elephants_Dream.ogg/seek%3D13-Elephants_Dream.ogg.jpg"
    duration="10:53" 
    linkback="http://www.elephantsdream.org/" >
    <source type="video/ogg" src="http://ia311040.us.archive.org/3/items/ElephantsDream/ed_1024.ogv" >
    <source type="video/h264" src="http://ia311040.us.archive.org/3/items/ElephantsDream/ed_hd_512kb.mp4" >
    <track kind="subtitles" id="video_af" srclang="af" 
         src="media/elephants_dream/elephant.afrikaans.srt"></track>
    <track kind="subtitles" id="video_en" srclang="en"  
         src="media/elephants_dream/elephant.english.srt"></track> 
  </video>
</body>
</html>

* For best compatibility: we include the poster, durationHint, width and height attributes. This way browsers such as IE can display the player interface with poster image at the correct resolution with a duration in the user interface.
* If you would like to support html5 with h.264 ( safari, IE9, google chrome) and support a flash fallback for older versions of IE you include an h.264 source. For best compatibility your mp4 source should ideally use a h.264 profile compatible with mobile devices such as the iPhone.  <a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/">Kaltura hosted Solutions</a> include iPhone support. Desktop video encoding software such as <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">handbreak</a> also includes iPhone profiles. 
* If you would like to change the theme you can change the class attribute @<video class="kskin">@ more info about custom theming is on the way. 

h2. Skinning

p. You can remove the kaltura attribution for the player by adding the following javascript: 

bc. <script type="text/javascript">mw.setConfig('EmbedPlayer.kalturaAttribution', false );</script>

p. You can add a custom jquery ui theme by using the theme wizard: "http://www.kaltura.org/apis/html5lib/kplayer-examples/Player_Themable.html":http://www.kaltura.org/apis/html5lib/kplayer-examples/Player_Themable.html

p. Downloading that theme and adding a reference to jquery-ui-.custom.css after the mwEmbed-player-static.css file.

h2. Fall Forward from Flash to html5 for iPhone & iPad Support

p. *Kaltura's HTML5 Video Library* may be installed in conjunction with existing flash video integrations to provide fall forward from flash to html5 to enable video embedding for iPhone and iPad.

p. Installing html5 support to an existing Kaltura integration is as simple as adding a javascript tag to include @http://html5.kaltura.org/js@.  The library will automatically replace your Flash embed with an html5 @<video>@ element on browsers capable of parsing the tag.

bc. <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Fall forward from Flash to html5</title>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://html5.kaltura.org/js"></script>

h2. Library features and showcase

* *Kaltura's HTML5 Video Library* is built on "jQuery":http://jquery.com/ and "jQueryUI":http://jqueryui.com/ so it's easy to theme, customize and extend.
* supports the *royalty free*, patent unencumbered *open media* formats "ogg theora/vorbis":http://xiph.org/ .

bq. This enables websites to distribute video without "future content distribution costs":http://mpegla.com/news/n_03-11-17_avc.html associated with the h.264 codec.

bq. If your already distributing h.264 formats, *Kaltura's HTML5 Video Library* supports a smooth transition with fallback to h.264 sources with the same html/css interface player skin as the ogg content.

* supports emerging *subtitles and timed text* formats for future proof accessibility.
* includes an easy to integrate free license *asset search system* for grabbing free content from repositories such as the "Internet Archive":http://www.archive.org/index.php, "Wikimedia Commons":http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page , and "Flickr":http://www.flickr.com/ . This lets you integrate quick access to freely reusable illustrative image or short web clip for your web app.
* includes components for flexible *client side transcoding* of assets via the "Firefogg":http://firefogg.org/ browser extension.

bq. Firefogg integration lets video sites avoid intermediary transcode formats for user contributed media, distribute transcode costs, and lets the website provide specific transcoding settings directly to the client at the point of upload.

* *Cross browser & Format compatibility* [see live demo: <a title="HTML5 Video Player with jQueryUI theme support" href="http://www.kaltura.org/apis/html5lib/kplayer-examples/Player_Fallback.html" rel="lightframe[|width:550px; height:650px; scrolling: auto;]">Video Player</a>, <a title="HTML5 Audio Player with jQueryUI theme support" href="http://www.kaltura.org/apis/html5lib/mwEmbed/tests/Player_Audio.html" rel="lightframe[|width:500px; height:500px; scrolling: auto;]">Audio Player</a>\] - Will work on all major browsers, and with any online supported video format. Gracefully identifys the best playback engine (Native HTML5, Flash, VLC or Java Cortado) for your settings and video format.
* *Easy to skin* [<a title="HTML5 Video Player with jQueryUI theme support" target="_blank" href="http://www.kaltura.org/apis/html5lib/kplayer-examples/Player_Themable.html">see live demo</a>] - Based on HTML, CSS and jQuery, skinning is amazingly easy and flexible. No need external or compiled resources (like Flash), or complicated development environments. Skin and Theme will be consistent through all UI and playback engines. Built in support for for the jquery Theme Roller for easy theming.
* *Easy to Extend, Javascript modules* -- Quick, clean and easy way of extending. Write once and the code will be compatible with all browsers and all playback engines. 
* *Javascript libraries for web applications* that allow much more then simple playback. Create a full featured web-video experience - <a title="HTML5 with jQueryUI content ingestion wizard" href="http://www.kaltura.org/apis/html5lib/kplayer-examples/Add_Media_Wizard.html" rel="lightframe[|width:850px; height:500px; scrolling: auto;]">Import and upload wizard</a>, <a title="HTML5 with jQueryUI online video editor" href="http://www.kaltura.org/apis/html5lib/mwEmbed/tests/Sequence_Editor.html" rel="lightframe[|width:900px; height:700px; scrolling: auto;]">Video Editor</a> ( not fully functional in stand alone mode yet ), <a title="FireOgg integration - Client Side Transcoding" href="http://www.kaltura.org/apis/html5lib/mwEmbed/example_usage/Firefogg_Make_Advanced.html" rel="lightframe[|width:550px; height:650px; scrolling: auto;]">Client Side Encoding (FireOgg)</a>.

h2. Troubleshooting

h3. Video Codecs

p. You will need to encode your video files into multiple codec formats to provide video for device platforms like iPhone, iPad, Android, and Blackberry.  "Dive into HTML5":http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html#firefogg provides an excellent reference for encoding these multiple video formats with "Firefogg":http://firefogg.org/ , FFmpeg, and Handbrake.

p. If you would prefer to not have to deal with encoding your videos into multiple formats, you should obtain a trial account with "Kaltura":http://corp.kaltura.com/ and request a support technician setup your account to provide html5 flavored video codecs.

h3. HTML5 @<video>@ MIME type

p. Note that if the MIME types for Theora video are not set on the server, the video may not show or show a gray box containing an X (if JavaScript is enabled).

p. You can fix this problem for the Apache Web Server by adding the extension used by Theora video files (".ogm", ".ogv", or ".ogg" are the common types) to the MIME type "video/ogg" via the "mime.types" file:

* Edit the mime.types apache configuration file (in "/etc/apache" on linux, "\xampp\apache\conf\mime.types" on windows-xampp)
* Search for `application/ogg     ogg` (if not exist skip this step), delete this line
* Add the following: `video/ogg     ogg ogm ogv`
* Restart apache

p. Or by adding the "AddType" configuration directive in httpd.conf - 

bc. AddType video/ogg .ogm
AddType video/ogg .ogv
AddType video/ogg .ogg
AddType video/mp4 .mp4
AddType video/webm .webm

p. Your web host may provide an easy interface to MIME type configuration changes for new technologies until a global update naturally occurs.
